## What are recommender systems?
Most of us have experienced the power of personalized recommendations firsthand. Maybe you found former colleagues and classmates with LinkedIn’s “People You May Know” feature. Perhaps you watched a movie because Netflix suggested it to you. And you’ve most likely bought something that Amazon recommended under “Frequently Bought Together” or “Customers Who Bought This.”

## Why are recommender system important?
Recommendation engines account for a huge share of revenue and user activity, often 30 to 50 percent, at those companies and countless others. 35 percent of what consumers purchase on Amazon and 75 percent of what they watch on Netflix come from product recommendations based on highly personalized marketing of which recommender systems play a large part.
