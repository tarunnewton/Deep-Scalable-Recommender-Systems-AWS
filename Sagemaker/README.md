# Amazon Sagemaker

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that allows developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.

Amazon SageMaker includes three modules: Build, Train, and Deploy. The Build module provides a hosted environment to work with your data, experiment with algorithms, and visualize your output. The Train module allows for one-click model training and tuning at high-scale and low cost. The Deploy module provides a managed environment for you to easily host and test models for inference securely and with low latency.
